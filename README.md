# QuestionTemplate

The project aims at generating math problems via template, so that content generator can create tons of questions in a flash, though they looks all the same. Also this project is kinda experiment project of generating Opympic Math (OM for short) questions that looks scary. 

The Goal is to quickly get some working examples, hence there would be only a bare minimum amount of documentation for the project. Feel free to contact lucius.cao@gmail.com if you have any questions or just curious about the project.

### Roadmap
What I've done, what I'm working on, and where I'm heading over.

###### MVP
- [x] A template resolver
- [x] A DSL parser  

####### OM solver
- [x] Operand solver
- [x] Match Game solver  

#######  continuous improvement (here is where we are)
- [ ] integrate template, DSL parser and OM solver together
- [ ] setup flask web env for web interface
